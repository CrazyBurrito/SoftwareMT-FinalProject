SoftFinalProject
================
http://railsapps.github.io/tutorial-rails-devise-rspec-cucumber.html

Please create a document called "Note to Instructor" and add it to your final project directory

This is a "read me" for the instructor/TA that will grade your final project

In it, please write down any information that changed from what your project proposal said you were going to do to what you actually implemented

If you said you were going to implement a certain feature and you didn't, make a note of that in "Note to Instructor" and tell us why you didn't implement it

If you implemented something in addition to what your proposed to do, let us know

If something doesn't work by the time you are submitting your project, let us know

This is not the place to describe your project! We already have your project description from your project proposal document

"Note to Instructor" should contain any information you think we might need in order to grade your final project properly

If you have more questions about this, please ask one of the TAs in class on monday or send an email to one of us.
